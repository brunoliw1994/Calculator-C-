# Calculator (C++)

As a Computer Science student, with this project I wish to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming and memory management in C++. This project helped me gain practical experience using classes, dynamic memory (`new` and `delete`), and basic error handling in a simple, user-friendly application.

This program is a **command-line calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is prompted to input two numbers and an operator. The program then calculates and displays the result. It also includes input validation for division by zero and continues to prompt the user until they choose to exit (choosing the option 'n' in the end).

My purpose for writing this program was to:
- Practice working with C++ classes and constructors
- Learn how to dynamically allocate and free memory using `new` and `delete`
- Refresh the knowledge I acquired about C++ in Brasil in 2014

# Future Work

* Add additional operations like modulus, power, and square root
* Store a history of calculations during the session
* Create a menu system to choose operations instead of typing symbols
* Add support for negative numbers and decimals
